.SH ENCHANT ORDERING FILE
Enchant has a global and a per-user ordering file named \fIenchant.ordering\fR.
It lets the user specify which spelling backend to use for individual
languages in the case when you care which backend gets used. The global
file is located in \fI$(datadir)/enchant\fR and the per-user file is
located in \fI~/.enchant\fR.
The per-user file takes precedence, if found.
.PP
The ordering file takes the form language_tag:<comma-separated list of spelling
backends>. I am currently aware of the following backends: aspell,
hunspell, uspell, hspell, voikko, zemberek, and Apple Spell (macOS only). '*' is
used to mean "use this ordering for all languages, unless instructed otherwise." For example:
.PP
*:aspell,hunspell
.br
en:aspell,hunspell
.br
en_GB:hunspell,aspell
.br
fr:hunspell,aspell
.SH DIRECTORIES IMPORTANT TO ENCHANT
Unless configured otherwise, Enchant's Hunspell and Uspell
backends will look for dictionaries in directories specific to Enchant,
and will not use your system-wide installed dictionaries. This is
because these dictionaries are installed
in different locations on different systems.
.PP
Like the \fIenchant.ordering\fR file described above, Enchant looks in
the global directory for these dictionaries and a per-user directory.
The per-user directory takes precedence if it is found.
Enchant looks for Hunspell dictionaries in \fI$(datadir)/enchant/hunspell\fR and \fI~/.enchant/hunspell\fR.
Enchant looks for Uspell dictionaries in \fI$(datadir)/enchant/uspell\fR and \fI~/.enchant/uspell\fR.
.PP
Packagers and users may wish to make symbolic links to the system\-wide dictionary directories. Or, preferably, use the \-\-with-hunspell-dir and \-\-with\-uspell\-dir 'configure' arguments.
